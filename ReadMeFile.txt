This program is designed and created to help the Learning Commons (library) at WelTec to manage borrowing and returns 
activities. This part of the program will cover only some functionalities that were mentioned in the assessment one descriptor.
These functionalities are: 
   1. Adding/removing library contents (books, articles, digital media. . . ).
   2. Listing all the contents (possibly by category (books, articles, digital media. . . )). 
   3. Display a list of borrowings for staff or students. Calculate and display penalty (if any).

   These functionalities will be implemented as the following: 

   When starting the program, the Library App form will appear first which has three options for users to choose or identify
   themselves. These options are ( Library staff, tutors, students) who will be the main or only users of this app, and each
   type of these users will have a different GUI with different functions. 

   All the users of the app will be able to view and search the library contents by using the search bar at the top of
   (Librarian,  tutor, student ) forms. These components are listed by category into three lists ( Books, Articles, and Media).
   
   Only library staff are able to add and remove items to the lists by using Add and remove buttons in the Librarian form 
   and save the details of the added items by using the "Save changes" button.

   In addition to view and search the library contents, tutors and students have the "View borrowed items" button in the
   tutor and student forms which take them to the "tutor borrowings list" or "student borrowings list" where they can view
   the list of their borrowings with some information such as ISBN, Author, Type, the year of publishing, the due date, and
   if it is renewed or not.
   
   student borrowings list also shows the overdue days of the item and the amount of penalty of each item.
